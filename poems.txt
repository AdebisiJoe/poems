my heart 
It is constantly set to achieve more
can easily wander and be torn,
but i have found a secert to make it rest,
Constantly abiding in his rest.

my heart cry 
Its to please him for whom my heart was made,
Its to see him for whom my gaze was made,
Its to know him for whom my life was made,

Even as i every day seek his my daily bread i must not forget,
That my heart can get distracted and forget,
It can silently crave other things 
so i must CONSTANTLY focus on one thing HIM ALONE.
